# Stock-QG
Stock Quick Gains.  This is a simple app to train recurrent neural nets on stock information among other things.  More of a proof of concept rather than a money making machine. I wanted to build a simple interface where anyone could train a machine learning model on a stock of their choice.  Still adding things to this project all the time.

## Built with
+ [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to simplify the stack.  
+ [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [Scikitlearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html)
+ [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/)

## API's used
+ [Yahoo](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) finance for the stock prices and history
+ [Coin Marketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) for crypto prices and history
